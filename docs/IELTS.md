The bar chart illustrates the frequency of swimming among people in Australia from 2001 to 2003.

In sum, the proportion of people who swam irregularly weekly and monthly was the highest. As foe those who swam with different frequencies, the trends varied from 2001 to 2003.

Of these, the largest group was those who swam at least once a week, with an average percentage of over 25% and a peak over 35%. Moreover, the percentage of people who swam one to two times a month was also high, with the lowest measurement being only 25%. At the same time, 15% to 20% of the population swam several times a week or several times a year, while only about 5% of people swam everyday or never swam at all. 
 
In 2002, there was a large incerase (about 5%) in the percentage of people who swam once a week and a considerable decline (more than 5%) in the percentage of people who swam once or twice a month. During these three years, there was relatively little variation in the percentage of people who swam daily or several times a year, fluctuating only by 1 to 2%. Of the trends monitored, only the percentage of those who never swam showed a continuous downward trend thoughout the course of the three years.
